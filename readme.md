# Sentiment analysis of YELP review for menu item recommendations
Our project recommends the best dishes for each restaunt by anaylsing the reviews in Yelp

## Project environment
1. The project has been implemented on Google colab
2. To connect to google drive from colab, run the below lines:

```bash
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount("/content/drive",force_remount=True)
```


## Project folder setup
1. We have submitted a project folder named NLP_project.zip
2. Extract the zip to get a folder named NLP_project
3. Upload the folder on Google Drive under the same name such that the directory path is:

```bash
/content/drive/My Drive/NLP_project
```
4. Once, you have connected to the google drive and have the project folder set up, change your directory to the above folder using the below command:

```bash
cd /content/drive/My Drive/NLP_project
```
5. The project folder will contain the below files:

```bash
1. NLP_project_final_code.ipynb : The colab jupyter notebook
2. businesses.json: raw file containing restaurant data
3. menus.json: raw file containing menu data
4. reviews.json: raw file containing reviews data
5. quadruples.csv: file generated after performing named entity recognition
6. glove.6B.100d.txt: glove embedding
7. GRU_project.model: GRU trained model
8. LSTM_project.model: LSTM trained model
9. recommendation.csv: result file after generating recommended dishes per restaurant
10.bert_folder: folder containing bert model and all intermediary files and folders generated by bert

bert_folder will contain a sub-folder named reviews: it will have the config and saved model generated after
fine tuning bert
```
## Usage
1. The colab jupyter notebook is well documented, kindly follow the comments for executing every cell.
2. The Generating Recommendations section can be run directly by loading already saved models present in the project folder. It has already been taken care of in the code.
3. Major time consuming sections: Named entity recognition (~6 hours); BERT training and prediction (~3 hours)
